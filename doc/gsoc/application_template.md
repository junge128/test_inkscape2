## Google Summer of Code - Candidate Application Template for Inkscape 

Thanks for considering Inkscape for your GSoC project! For writing
a good proposal, consider [the official guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).

To help us identifying you as a good candidate, we ask a few questions.

### Inkscape Questions

1.  When did you first hear about Inkscape?
2.  What do you use Inkscape for?
3.  Describe your participation in our community (e.g. uploaded
    drawings, tutorials, bug reports, communication via mailing lists or
    chat, user support).
4.  Describe your contributions to the Inkscape development (e.g. bug
    fixes, translations, packaging, testing).
5.  In exactly **two** sentences, why should we pick **YOU**?

### About Yourself

1.  What is your name, email address, and chat nickname?
2.  Describe any plans you have for the summer in addition to GSoC
    (classes, thesis, job, vacation, etc.).
3.  What programming projects have you completed?
4.  Describe any work on other open-source projects.
5.  List other GSoC projects you are applying to.

### Tasks

1.  Submit a drawing you have made with Inkscape. It doesn\'t have to be
    professional quality but it should show us that you know how to use
    Inkscape.
2.  Introduce yourself on the [Inkscape
    chat](https://chat.inkscape.org), and discuss your project ideas for
    feedback, *before* submitting your application
3.  [Checkout](https://inkscape.org/develop/getting-started/) the
    Inkscape sourcecode through git and review it. Make sure you can
    compile and build Inkscape on your own PC!
    *If your project targets another part of the Inkscape codebase, such
    as extensions or the website, check out that part and make sure the
    tests pass on your system.*
4.  Find and fix two bugs in the [Inkscape bug
    tracker](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape/issues). Create and
    upload patches for the bugs, and make sure we know to connect those
    bug fixes and your GSoC application. You can alternatively submit a
    patch that improves code unrelated to a bug. **The patches must be
    related to your proposed project and show us that you have the skills
    needed to succeed in the project.**
5.  Prepare a detailed plan (with timetable) of the work you want to do.
6.  Explain any additional costs that the project would have to cover in
    order for you to perform this work, such as license costs for
    proprietary tools (when no suitable OSS replacement exists) or
    hardware costs (e.g. when the target is to support specific
    hardware). There is no guarantee that these costs can be reimbursed,
    but we still need to know in advance.
