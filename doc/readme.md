# Developer documentation

This directory contains documentation for (future and current) Inkscape
contibutors. User-facing documentation is available at 
 - the [beginners' guide](https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
 - the (partially outdated) [manual](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/)

This directory was purged after the switch to GTK4 because the documentation was
outdated. It lives on in the 1.4.x branch (and earlier ones).
