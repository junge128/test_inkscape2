/**
 * General-purpose, parallel thread dispatch mechanism.
 *
 * A dispatch is a compute job which is parameterized by a counter. It can also be thought of
 * as a way to parallelize a for loop. For example, the following single-threaded loop
 *
 *     for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
 *         do_work(i);
 *     }
 *
 * can be rewritten to use a dispatch_pool and operate in parallel like this:
 *
 *     pool.dispatch(count, [&](int i, int local_id) {
 *         do_work(i);
 *     });
 *
 * Finally, it is also possible to perform all jobs on the calling thread unless a threshold
 * condition is met (like dispatch size). This can be used if threading the operation would be
 * less efficient unless the work is at least a certain size:
 *
 *     pool.dispatch_threshold(count, count > 1024, [&](int i, int local_id) {
 *         do_work(i);
 *     });
 *
 * Unlike boost's asio::thread_pool, which pushes work for threads onto a queue, this class only
 * supports operation via a counter. The simpler design allows dispatching a very large amount of
 * work (potentially millions of jobs, for every pixel in a megapixel image) with constant
 * memory and space used.
 *
 * A pool's thread count is fixed upon construction and cannot change during operation. If you
 * allocate work buffers for each thread in the pool, you can use the size() method to determine
 * how many threads it has been created with.
 *
 * By design, only one dispatch may run at a time. It is safe to call dispatch() from multiple
 * threads without extra locking.
 *
 * Terminology used is designed to loosely follow that of OpenCL kernels or GL/VK compute shaders:
 * - Global ID within a dispatch refers to the 0-based counter value for a given job.
 * - Local ID within a dispatch refers to the 0-based index of thread which is processing the job.
 *   This will always be less than the pool's size().
 *
 * The first parameter to the callback is global ID. The second parameter, which is unused in the
 * example, is the local ID. The local ID is primarily useful if a work buffer is allocated for
 * each thread in the dispatch_pool ahead of time.
