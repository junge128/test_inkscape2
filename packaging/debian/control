Description: vector-based drawing program
 Inkscape is an illustration editor which has everything needed to
 create professional-quality computer art. You can use it to make
 diagrams and illustrations, technical drawings, web graphics, clip art,
 icons and logos. A collection of hands-on tutorials show you how to
 combine lines, shapes and text of different types and styles to build
 up a picture.
 .
 A selection of powerful vector graphics editing tools comes as
 standard. There is excellent support for paths, gradients, layers,
 alpha transparency and text flow control. An extensive library of
 filters allow you to apply realistic effects and extensions allow you
 to work with bitmaps, barcodes and printing marks, amongst other things.
 .
 Most of the common vector formats are supported, including PDF, Adobe
 Illustrator and AutoCAD files, and it has unrivalled support for the
 SVG web graphics standard.

Package: lib2geom1.5.0
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: robust computational geometry framework -- shared library
 2Geom is a C++ 2D geometry library geared towards robust processing of
 computational geometry data associated with vector graphics. The primary
 design consideration is ease of use and clarity. It is dual-licensed
 under LGPL 2.1 and MPL 1.1.
 .
 The library is descended from a set of geometric routines present in
 Inkscape, a vector graphics editor based around the Scalable Vector
 Graphics format, the most widespread vector graphics interchange format
 on the Web and a W3C Recommendation. Due to this legacy, not all parts
 of the API form a coherent whole (yet).
 .
 Rendering is outside the scope of this library, and it is assumed
 something like libcairo or similar is employed for this.  2geom
 concentrates on higher level algorithms and geometric computations.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

 This package contains the Minwaita theme and the Dash, Tango and
 multicolor icon sets.
